# THE LIST (WWII Game)


## Game Background:


A month before D-Day, operating as a british intelligence officer, you are closely monitoring encrypted radio communications among high ranking german officers related to the upcoming plot (Operation Valkyrie) to assassinate Adolf Hitler.

Unfortunately, the Gestapo is closing in on the conspirators as well. They have produced a list of double agents working for them extracted from several SS ranks and posing as regular Wehrmacht officers to infiltrate the conspiracy.

Using your customized ENIGMA machine captured in combat, you are able to intercept this encrypted radio traffic and expose their double agents REAL names and ranks, so that your assets on the ground are able to take them out before they pose a real threat to the conspirators before they get a chance to execute their plan.


## Instructions:


The health of your machine is measured on vacuum tubes, requiring a number between 1 and 10 to function properly.

Below the input field, you start the game by pressing the button with the MI-5 logo to the right. The machine will start to receive encrypted morse code traffic and will play it back to you. The machine also will start producing a key punch tape with the morse code corresponding to the encrypted transmission. The bulbs across the light board will go on and off in pairs, one bulb for the encrypted traffic and the other one for the machine's decryption mechanism.

Using the sound and the visual morse reference, write down the decrypted message letter by letter as its corresponding lightbulb would not have a corresponding sound or printed code.

Relay your orders by submitting the decoded message using the button to the left under the input field.

The decrypted string will be a rank, first and last name of a double agent, in lowercase and without spaces.


## Points System:

Depending on the rank of the double agent, the points are rewarded to you as vacuum tubes for your enigma machine. The game is won by getting ten or more tubes, and lost when all the tubes break down and reach zero.

Points are awarded as follows:

- 1 point for Enlisted personnel.
- 2 points for NCOs.
- 3 points for Officers.
- 4 points for Generals.

In case the message is not properly decoded, the target's value will be deducted. The operator has the option of passing by deducting just one point. This is done by pressing the relay orders button to the left, while the input field is empty.
